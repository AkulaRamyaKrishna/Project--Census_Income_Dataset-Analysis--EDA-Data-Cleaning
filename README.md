# Census Income Dataset - EDA & Data Cleaning

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Data Cleaning (DC)** on the Census Income Dataset.  
The goal is to preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, and then explore patterns, trends, and insights from the data.

## Key Steps
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, formatting issues)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (summary statistics, visualizations, distributions)
- Insights extraction from demographic and income-related variables

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Adult Census Income Dataset**, commonly available on [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) and Kaggle.
